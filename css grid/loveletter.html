<p text-align=center style="font-size:60px"><i>few years back i went to my college JIIT where i met pulkit way tooo intelligent nd shy... haayeee dekh kr bilkul ssss type wali feel a jaye  i.e simple sanskaari shusheel aur shaant kid.Meri tut me baat hui usse waise to i m very judgy kind of girl bt usse  dekhkr kbhi judgement wali feel nhi ayi ...its like ki ky hi judge kru isko he is so sweet ...waise to wo mere workshop grp me tha bt he never noticed me its like we have hardly  any  memorable conversation except the one where he said that he is so serious kind of person and at that very moment  i thought ohh godd he is nt my kind of person ...haan mtlb normal friend kind of person .... fr uske bad bht se friends bne then after one nd half years we decided to go to a photocopy center mtlb seriously somehow from no where jo log baat bhi nhi krte the wo aj subh subh photocopy ke liye wondering here nd there aur result kuch bhi nhi tha aisa kuch bhi sochne layak nhi h waise isme its like 1 mi hi thi jise als nhi ata tha to hum chle gi baaki koi reason nhi h...nd there also i never thought ki hum kbhi friends bnenge...hum holi ki vacation se pehle bhi mile jha mine chillipotato khayi thi i asked him bt he denied ab itne time me itna to smjh hi gi thi that he is uncomfortable to share food with me thats why i also did nt forced him  (lekin  pulkit ko oily food nhi psnd tha fr the sake of saying only i guess q ki use srf reason chahiye tha mna krne ka)...to ye thi hmari holi break se pehle ki kuch yaadien MR.pulkit ke sath 
And here is the turning point in my story i was so boredd in house nd upset too as the govt extended holiday nd on those following days i replied to his text privately which he asked on grp aur use sbne ignore kr diya .
hmne baat ki nd we were like hum dono se koi baat nhi krta to hum 1 doosre se baat krte h aur fr krte krte humari baatein hone lgi mtlb it wont be wrong if i would say the most unexpected nd beautiful things happened to me (sorry us*)that day.Its like we started sharing those thing jo sayd hi hmne kisise share kri ho ...dheere dheere  batein bdhti gii hmare talking duration bdhte gii .. 1 normal batchmates se hum 1 doosre ke liye itne acche friends bn gi  the that even we could nt imaginend now pulkit become Pulkit samrat to me use samrat psnd nhi tha bt mi to  mi hu mi to bolungi hi....fr text se batein call pr hone lgi walk krte time baat krne ki adt ho gi thi aur uske hmm aur logical reason ki  bhi sayd ...  Mi usse hmesha khti thi ki meri taareef kro yrr aur pagl hmesha meri tareef krta tha its like us bhole se bacche ko kitna irritate krti thi mi apni hrkato  se aur ye abhi bhi mujhe lgta h ki kaise jhelta tha mujhe itna .uske baad we like satrted making plans ki yha jayenge yha khayenge and jis bnde ko oily food nhi psnd tha ab wo chillipotato bhi khane ke liye ready tha mere sath ..ya fr sayd mujhe ye kehna chahiye ki anything that makes me happy aur jo meri favourite h wo to use krni hi h aur fr dheere dheere meri sari favourite cheeze usey psnd ane lgi nd by that time we bacame the irreplacable person in each  other  life...we made promises srf kehne ke liye nibhane ke liye forever friends rhne ke promises kbhi jhgda na krne ke promises  bht sare promises krte krte hum aur bhi close ho gi then we started knowing each other wishes nd there he asked me to hug me nd i said yes i dont know why may be somewhere i also wanted this tooo..aise hi wishes krte krte mi uske life me special friend bn gi ....ohh ye add krna to bhul hi gi ki wo faatuuu h aur thoda confused bhi....hum dono ko hi nhi pta tha ki why we wanted us to be this close bt we never have any prblm with this closeness..ab itne close a rhe the to insecurity bhi to ani hi thi darr to usse bhi tha pr wo km bolta h na isliye usne nhi kha pr mujhe accha nhi lgta tha jb wo mujhe wait krata tha isa q hota tha tha mujhe bhi nhi pta ha aur usse bhi  mujhe wait krana psnd nhi tha but still hum sure nhi the fr mi gussa thi aur there he texted me so long text msgs   nd at that moment i was so scared us din mujhe use khone ka dar tha.. its like that special bond is going to end bt somewhere we manged to sort it out and i guess at that moment we realised that we cant live without each other..mine to bola bhi tha pagl se ki I LOVE YOU nt as a friend aur pulkit samrat replied that he too LOVE ME but as a friend(friendzone kr diya) ... oh god that terrible feeling ..i was sad bt i dont want to lose him becoz with him everything was so perfect ..he cared fr me a lot nd may be i sound little bit greedy but yes i needed that person so badly that i agreed to the point that  its okk na ky hua if he love me as a friend ...pyaar usey bhi tha bt ijhaar nhi krna q ki wo to h hi fattu abhi bhi h..dheere dheere frse hmari baat hui fr finally hmne decide ki ye kuch special h  but ky h pta nhi tha bs bna kisi bhi cheez ki fikr kiye we planned everything that  couple use to do when they r in love ..its like 24*7 plan  hmesha sath rehne ka promise ...nd finally we realised ki haan ye kuch alg h then finally we decided to be in relationship officially on 20 AUG at 8:08 pm...haaye re wo moment we were so happy  mujhe believe nhi ho rha tha pulkit ggg jise relationship me bhraosa nhi tha  finally wanted us to be in relationship...fr kya ab to sb official tha humari wishes bdhti gii ...hum aur close ate gii 1 doosre ki aadt itni ho gi ki ab to agr raaat na ho to hum poore time 1 doosre se baat krte rhe ..nd our  bond getting stronger day by day by our love nd lots of care...to ye thi hmari  unexpected si love story bt kaafi pyaari  aur  original si jha kisine kisiko officially knee pr akr propose nhi kiya... hath me ring lekr pocha nhi that would u be mine forever ...aur sayd shi bhi h q ki we wanted each other so badly ki propsal ki jroort kisey h .
